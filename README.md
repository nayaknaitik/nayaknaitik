# Hi, I’m Naitik 👋

I’m a developer focused on building **AI-powered systems**, **backend-first applications**, and **practical tools** that solve real problems.  
I care about understanding systems deeply — how data moves, how AI is integrated, and how software behaves in production.

## What I Work On

- **AI Agents & RAG Systems**  
  Building LangChain-based agents, retrieval pipelines, embeddings, and vector search systems.

- **Backend Engineering**  
  Designing clean APIs, handling business logic, databases, and scalable architectures.

- **Full-Stack (When Needed)**  
  Frontends that support functionality and clarity, not unnecessary complexity.
